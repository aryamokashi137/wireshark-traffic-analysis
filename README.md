# Network Traffic Analysis using Wireshark - Beginner Cybersecurity Project

## 🔎 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing network traffic using **Wireshark** to identify the differences between legitimate and malicious packets.  
By inspecting packet-level details such as DNS records, HTTP/HTTPS traffic, and raw payloads, we explored how attackers may hide data and how unusual patterns can signal threats.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand how Wireshark captures and displays packets.  
- Differentiate between **legitimate traffic** (e.g., DNS queries, HTTP/HTTPS requests) and **malicious traffic** (e.g., suspicious payloads, unusual highlights, malformed packets).  
- Gain hands-on experience with interpreting raw packet data using Wireshark.  
- Document findings in a structured report for cybersecurity learning.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Wireshark** – For packet capture and analysis  
- **PCAP files** – To simulate real-world traffic scenarios 

## 🔍 Key Learnings
- Basics of packet capturing and analysis with Wireshark.  
- Difference between **A Records** and **HTTPS Records** in DNS responses.  
- Identifying unusual/malicious packets based on missing or abnormal data.  
- Understanding how ICMP behavior varies across websites.
